# Description
At the start of each round you have five covered Cards laying in front of you, which two of them you can look at. After that the fun begins. You can change your own cards with the ones from the discard pile or you can steal and switch your cards with another player. 
The goal of this game is to have the fewest Points at the end, which determines the winner.
